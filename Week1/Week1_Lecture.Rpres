The R Project for Statistical Computing
========================================================

* Open source
* Data manipulation
* Data analysis tools
* Great graphics
* Programming language
* 6,000+ free, community-contributed packages
* A supportive and increasing user community

R is a dialect of the S language and environment developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T) by John Chambers and colleagues (the same group that developed C and UNIX¬©)


What is the R environment?
========================================================
* an effective data handling and storage facility
* a suite of operators for (vectorized) calculations
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of tools for data analysis
* graphical capabilities (screen or hardcopy)
* a well-developed, simple, and effective programming language  which includes
  * conditionals
  * loops
  * user defined functions
  * input and output facilities

Parallel Processing
=======

For *BIG* jobs:

multi-core processors / high performance computing

Strengths & Limitations
=======

* Just-in-time compilation: 
  * <span style="color:red"> Slower than compiled languages (-) </span>
  * <span style="color:green">  Faster to compose and develop (+) </span>
* <span style="color:green"> Many available packages (+) </span>
* Most operations conducted in RAM
  * <span style="color:red"> RAM can be limiting and/or expensive (-) </span>
  * <span style="color:red"> ‚ÄúError: cannot allocate vector of size X Mb‚Äù </span>
  * <span style="color:green"> Various packages and clever programming can overcome this‚Ä¶ (+) </span>
* <span style="color:green"> Free like beer and speech! (+) </span>
