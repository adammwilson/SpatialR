## Data wrangling

### Useful packages: [`dplyr`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)  and [`tidyr`]()

[Cheat sheets on website](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for [Data Wrangling](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

```{r,results='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```
Remember use `install.packages("dplyr")` to install a new package.

---
##  Example operations from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)

### New York City Flights
Data from [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) (see `?nycflights13`)
```{r,results='hide'}
library(nycflights13)
```
Check out the `flights` object
```{r}
head(flights)
```

---
## Object _Structure_
Check out data _structure_ with `str()`
```{r}
str(flights)
```

---
## `dplyr` "verbs" of data manipulation

* `select()` and `rename()`: Extract existing variables
* `filter()` and `slice()`: Extract existing observations
* `arrange()`
* `distinct()`
* `mutate()` and `transmute()`: Derive new variables
* `summarise()`: Change the unit of analysis
* `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()`

---
## Useful select functions

* "`-`"  Select everything but
* "`:`"  Select range
* `contains()` Select columns whose name contains a character string
* `ends_with()` Select columns whose name ends with a string
* `everything()` Select every column
* `matches()` Select columns whose name matches a regular expression
* `num_range()` Select columns named x1, x2, x3, x4, x5
* `one_of()` Select columns whose names are in a group of names
* `starts_with()` Select columns whose name starts with a character string

---
## `select()` examples
Select only the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns:
```{r}
select(flights,year, month, day)
```

---
## `select()` examples

Select everything _except_ the `tailnum`:
```{r}
select(flights,-tailnum)
```

---
## `select()` examples

Select all columns containing the string `"time"`:
```{r}
select(flights,contains("time"))
```

---

## `select()` examples

You can also rename columns with `select()`
```{r}
select(flights,year,carrier,destination=dest)
```

---
## `filter()` observations

Filter all flights that departed on on January 1st:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


---
## _Base_ R method
This is equivalent to the more verbose code in base R:

```{r}
flights[flights$month == 1 & flights$day == 1, ]
```

Compare with `dplyr` method: 
```{r,eval=F}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)`
```

---
## Filter excercise
> Filter the `flights` data set to keep only evening flights (`dep_time` after 1600) in June.

---

```{r, purl=FALSE}
filter(flights,dep_time>1600,month==6)
```

---
## Other _boolean_ expressions
`filter()` is similar to `subset()` except it handles any number of filtering conditions joined together with `&`. 

You can also use other boolean operators, such as _OR_ ("|"):
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 2)
```

---
## Filter excercise

> Filter the `flights` data set to keep only 'redeye' flights where the departure time (`dep_time`) is "after" the arrival time (`arr_time`), indicating it arrived the next day:


---

```{r, purl=FALSE}
filter(flights,dep_time>arr_time)
```


---
## Select rows by position using slice():
```{r}
slice(flights, 1:10)
```

---
## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

`arrange()` is similar to `filter()` except it reorders instead of filtering.  

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```
_Base_ R method:
```{r,eval=F}
flights[order(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day), ]
```

---
## Use `desc()` for descending order:

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

_Base_ R method:
```{r,eval=F}
flights[order(desc(flights$arr_delay)), ]
```


---
## Distinct: Find distinct rows

```{r}
distinct(
  select(flights,carrier)
)
```

---
## Mutate: Derive new variables

Adds columns with calculations based on other columns.


Average air speed (miles/hour):
```{r}
select(
  mutate(flights,ave_speed=distance/(air_time/60)),
  distance, air_time,ave_speed)
```

---

## Chaining Operations
Performing multiple operations sequentially with a _pipe_ character

```{r}
a1 <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
a2 <- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)
a3 <- summarise(a2,
  arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
  dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
a4 <- filter(a3, arr > 30 | dep > 30)
head(a4)
```

---
## Chaining Operations
If you donâ€™t want to save the intermediate results: wrap the function calls inside each other:

```{r}
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

Arguments are distant from function -> difficult to read!  

---
## Chaining Operations

`%>%` allows you to _pipe_ together various commands

`x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)`


So you can use it to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom:
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```

---
## Analyze by group with `group_by()`
Perform operations by _group_: mean departure delay by airport (`origin`)

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=T))
```


---
## Analyze by group with `group_by()`
Perform operations by _group_: mean and sd departure delay by airline (`carrier`)

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%  
  summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=T),
            sdDelay =   sd(dep_delay,na.rm=T))
```


---
## Analyze by group with `group_by()`

> Flights from which `origin` airport go the farthest (on average)?  

Calculate the maximum flight distance (`distance`) by airport (`origin`).

---

```{r,purl=F}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>%  
  summarise(meanDist = mean(distance,na.rm=T),
            maxDist = max(distance,na.rm=T))
```

---

> Which destination airport (`dest`) is the farthest (`distance`) from NYC?

--- 

```{r, purl=F}
flights %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>% 
  select(dest,distance) %>% 
  slice(1)

```
> What airport is that?

# Combining data sets

## `dplyr` _join_ methods
![join](assets/img/join1.png)

---
## `dplyr` _join_ methods

![join](assets/img/join1.png)

* `left_join(a, b, by = "x1")` Join matching rows from b to a.
* `right_join(a, b, by = "x1")` Join matching rows from a to b.
* `inner_join(a, b, by = "x1")` Retain only rows in both sets.
* `full_join(a, b, by = "x1")` Join data. Retain all values, all rows.

--- 
## `dplyr` _join_ methods

`left_join(a, b, by = "x1")` Join matching rows from b to a.

## `dplyr` _join_ methods

```{r}
flights%>%select(-year,-month,-day,-hour,-minute,-dep_time,-dep_delay)%>%str()
```

Let's look at the `airports` data table (`?airports` for documentation):
```{r}
str(airports)
```

--- 
## `dplyr` _join_ methods

> What is the name of the destination airport farthest from the NYC airports?


Hints:

* Use a _join_ to connect the `flights` dataset and `airports` dataset.
* Figure out which column connects the two tables.
* You may need to rename the column names before joining.

--- 
## `dplyr` _join_ methods

> What is the name of the airport farthest from the NYC airports?

```{r}
select(airports,dest=faa,destName=name)%>%
  right_join(flights)%>% 
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  select(destName)
```


---
## Plot the `flights` data

Join destination airports.  First select and rename needed variables:

```{r}
select(airports,dest=faa,destName=name,destLat=lat,destLon=lon)
``` 

---

```{r}
library(geosphere)
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(sp)
library(rgeos)

data=
  select(airports,dest=faa,destName=name,destLat=lat,destLon=lon)%>%
  right_join(flights)%>%
  group_by(dest,destLon,destLat,distance)%>%
  summarise(count=n())%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  select(destLon,destLat,count,distance)%>%
  mutate(id=row_number())%>%
  na.omit()

NYCll=airports%>%filter(faa=="JFK")%>%select(lon,lat)  # get NYC coordinates

# calculate great circle routes
rts <- gcIntermediate(as.matrix(NYCll), as.matrix(select(data,destLon,destLat)), 1000, addStartEnd=TRUE, sp=TRUE)
rts.ff <- fortify(as(rts,"SpatialLinesDataFrame")) # convert into something ggplot can plot

## join with count of flights
rts.ff$id=as.integer(rts.ff$id)
gcircles <- left_join(rts.ff, data, by="id") # join attributes, we keep them all, just in case

```

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=6,dpi=300}
base=ggplot()
worldmap <- map_data("world",ylim=c(10,70),xlim=c(-160,-80))
wrld<-c(geom_polygon(aes(long,lat,group=group), 
                     size = 0.1, colour= "grey", fill="grey", alpha=1, data=worldmap))
base+wrld+geom_path(data=gcircles, aes(long,lat,col=count,group=group,order=as.factor(distance)),
                    alpha=0.5, lineend="round",lwd=1)+
  coord_equal()+
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("blue","orange","red"),guide = "colourbar")+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill='white',colour='white'))+
  labs(y="Latitude",x="Longitude",title="Count of Flights from New York in 2013")
```
