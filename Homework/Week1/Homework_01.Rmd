```
## Question 1
Load the iris dataset by running
```{r} 
data(iris)
```

> How many observations (rows) are there for the versicolor species?
```{r, purl=F}
table(iris$Species)
# or
nrow(iris[iris$Species=="versicolor",])
```


## Question 2
Create a vector with the following values:  23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18.  Then multiply each element of the vector by 15.  

> What is the standard deviation of the new vector? 

```{r, purl=F}
x=c(23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18)
x=x*15
sd(x)

# or

sd(c(23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18)*15)

```

## Question 3
Start with a vector containing missing values
```{r}
x=c(12,23,NA,34,12,67,12,NA,23)
```
> What is the mean (excluding the NA values)?

```{r, purl=F}
mean(x,na.rm=T)
#or
x1=na.omit(x)
mean(x1)
#or 
x1=x[!is.na(x)]
mean(x1)
```

## Question 4
